                 U.S. Direct Investment Abroad:
Operations of U.S. Parent Companies and Their Foreign Affiliates

                     Revised 1996 Estimates

     This publication presents revised estimates covering the
financial structure and operations of nonbank U.S. multinational
companies (MNC's) and their nonbank foreign affiliates for the
fiscal year 1996.  These estimates supplement those in "U.S.
Multinational Companies:  Operations in 1997" in the July
1999 Survey of Current Business.  That article presents estimates
of key items for 1996 and 1997 and highlights major developments
in 1997.
     The estimates in this publication cover the universe of
nonbank U.S. parent companies and their nonbank foreign
affiliates.  They were derived by combining sample data reported
in the Annual Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, 1996,
conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), with BEA
estimates of data for affiliates not in the sample.  Estimates
for nonsample parents and affiliates that existed in prior years
were derived by extrapolating forward the data reported for them
in BEA's 1994 benchmark survey of U.S. direct investment abroad.
     The concepts and definitions underlying the estimates in
this publication are the same as those used for BEA's 1989 and
1994 benchmark surveys.  These concepts and definitions are
described in the benchmark survey publication, U.S. Direct
Investment Abroad:  1994 Benchmark Survey, Final Results.
     Publications presenting estimates comparable to the 1996
estimates in this publication are available for 1977, for
1982-95, and for 1997.  The estimates for 1983-97 are also
available on diskette.  Ordering information for publications and
diskettes is given at the back of this volume.  In addition,
compressed files corresponding to the diskettes are available
free of charge on BEA's Web site.  Go to <www.bea.doc.gov> and
click on Catalog of Products.
     Because the estimates for 1977, 1982, 1989, and 1994 are
based on benchmark surveys--which are more comprehensive in scope
than annual surveys--publications for those years contain
measures of MNC operations that are not available for other
years.  Types of data that are collected only in benchmark
surveys include hourly compensation of production workers of
foreign affiliates in manufacturing,  U.S. trade in goods of
MNC's by product, and the number of U.S. citizens employed by
foreign affiliates.
     Table 1 lists the tables in this publication and gives the
table numbers for comparable tables in the annual survey
publications for 1990-93.  To aid comparison between the final
1994 benchmark survey data and the annual survey estimates for
subsequent years, the table numbers in the annual survey
publications for 1995 forward, including those in this
publication, are identical to the ones used in the final 1994
benchmark survey publication.  Thus, tables prefixed with the
Roman numeral II present estimates for nonbank foreign affiliates
and their nonbank U.S. parents, and tables prefixed with the
Roman numeral III present estimates for majority-owned nonbank
foreign affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents.  (Unlike the final
1994 benchmark survey publication, Roman numeral I is not used to
number tables in this publication because it designates tables
covering all foreign affiliates and their U.S. parents, including
bank parents and affiliates, which are not covered by this
publication.)
     In some cases, BEA may make special tabulations or perform
regressions or other statistical analyses of annual survey data
at cost, within limits of available resources and subject to the
legal requirement to avoid disclosure of data of individual
companies in the results.  However, because of the high degree of
detail in which BEA's data are regularly produced and because of
concerns about confidentiality, data quality, and consistency of
presentation, the Bureau has adopted a policy of generally
limiting tabulations to those regularly produced.  Data users
requiring special tabulations should submit their requests,
including a justification of need, in writing, and BEA will
consider each request on a case-by-case basis.  Requests should
be directed to the International Investment Division (BE-50),
Data Retrieval and Analysis Branch, Bureau of Economic Analysis,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.

                     General Notes to Tables

       The estimates are on a fiscal year (FY) basis; an affiliate's
    fiscal year is defined as the financial reporting year that
    ended in that calendar year.  Unless otherwise specified, all
    balances are as of the close of FY 1996.

       Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.

       An asterisk "(*)" indicates a value between -$500,000 and
    +$500,000, or fewer than 50 employees, as appropriate.

       A "(D)" indicates that the data in the cell have been
    suppressed to avoid disclosure of data of individual
    companies.

       A "U.S. parent company" is the person, resident in the United
    States, that owns or controls 10 percent or more of the voting
    securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise or
    an equivalent interest in an unincorporated foreign business
    enterprise.  "Person" is broadly defined to include any
    individual, branch, partnership, associated group,
    association, estate, trust, corporation or other organization
    (whether or not organized under the laws of any State), or any
    government entity.  If incorporated, the U.S. parent is the
    fully consolidated U.S. enterprise consisting of (1) the U.S.
    corporation whose voting securities are not owned more than 50
    percent by another U.S. corporation, and (2)  proceeding down
    each ownership chain from that U.S. corporation, any U.S.
    corporation (including Foreign Sales Corporations located
    within the United States) whose voting securities are more
    than 50 percent owned by the U.S. corporation above it.  A
    U.S. parent comprises the domestic (U.S.) operations of a U.S.
    multinational company.

       A "foreign affiliate" is a foreign business enterprise in
    which there is U.S. direct investment, that is, in which a
    U.S. person owns or controls 10 percent of the voting
    securities or the equivalent.  Foreign affiliates comprise the
    foreign operations of a U.S. multinational company over which
    the U.S. parent is presumed to have a degree of managerial
    influence.

       A "majority-owned nonbank affiliate" (MOFA) is a foreign
    affiliate in which the combined direct and indirect ownership
    interest of all U.S. parents exceeds 50 percent.  MOFA's
    comprise the foreign operations of a U.S. MNC that are
    unambiguously controlled by the U.S. parent(s).

       The tables cover only nonbank parents and affiliates.  Nonbank
    parents (affiliates) exclude parents (affiliates) classified
    as depository institutions, which consist of commercial banks,
    savings institutions, and credit unions.

       The designation "by country" in a table title indicates that
    data are disaggregated by country of foreign affiliate.

       Unless otherwise specified, the designation "by industry" in a
    table title indicates that the data are disaggregated by
    industry of foreign affiliate.

       For tables that do not show every individual country or
    industry, the individual countries or industries included in a
    country or industry group shown in the heading or stub may be
    found in table II.A 1 or III.A 1 (for countries) or table II.A
    2 or III.A 2 (for industries).  The industries listed in table
    II.A 2 and III.A 2 are described in BEA's Guide to Industry
    and Foreign Trade Classifications for International Surveys.

       The country category "international" consists of affiliates
    that have operations spanning more than one country and that
    are engaged in petroleum shipping, other water transportation,
    or oil and gas drilling.

       "Eastern Europe" comprises Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
    Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary,
    Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania,
    Russia, Slovakia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and
    Uzbekistan.

       The European Union (15) comprises Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
    Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
    the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United
    Kingdom.

       OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
    Its members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
    Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and
    Venezuela.

       In BEA's direct investment statistics, petroleum is presented
    as a major industry that consolidates all the activities
    associated with petroleum production, transportation, and
    distribution.  Consequently, in this publication, the data for
    these activities are excluded from major industries in which
    they would usually be included.  In particular, manufacturing
    excludes petroleum and coal products manufacturing, mining
    excludes oil and gas extraction, wholesale trade excludes
    petroleum wholesale trade, retail trade excludes gasoline
    service stations, and transportation excludes petroleum tanker
    operations, pipelines, and storage.

   All footnotes follow the last table.
                      Footnotes to Tables

Table II.L1:

1. Includes capitalized expenditures for land, timber, mineral
and like rights owned, structures, machinery, equipment, special
tools, and other depreciable property; construction in
progress; and capitalized and expensed tangible and intangible
exploration and development costs (but not the costs
of other types of intangible assets) and land held for
resale.

2. Measures expenditures for research and development conducted
by the parents, whether for themselves or for others under
contract.  Excludes expenditures for research and development
conducted by others for parents under contract.

Table II.Q1:

1. Sales of goods are defined as sales generated by activities
characteristic of establishments in the following group of
industries: Agriculture (except agricultural services), forestry,
and fishing; mining, except mining services; petroleum, except
petroleum services; construction; manufacturing; and wholesale
and retail trade.

2. Sales of services are defined as sales generated by
activities characteristic of establishments in the following
group of industries:  The "services" division of the Standard
Industrial Classification (and the International Surveys
Industry Classification) system; petroleum services; finance,
insurance, and real estate; agricultural services; mining
services; transportation; communication; and public utilities.

3. Consists of investment income that is included in sales (or
gross operating revenues) in the income statement.  In finance
and insurance, companies generally include investment income in
sales because it is generated by a primary activity of the
company.  In most other industries, companies generally consider
investment income an incidental revenue source and include it in
the income statement in a separate "other income" category; in
such cases, investment income is not included in sales or in this
column.

Table II.Q2:

1. For industry classification, each U.S. parent was required to
disaggregate its sales by three-digit International Surveys
Industry code; the U.S. parent was then classified in the
industry in which its sales were largest.  When sales are
disaggregated by industry of U.S. parent, total sales of a given
U.S. parent are shown in the single industry in which the parent
was classified; when disaggregated by industry of sales, they are
distributed among all the industries in which the U.S. parent
reported sales--i.e., sales associated with each industry of
sales are shown in that industry regardless of the U.S. parent's
industry of classification.

2. In the breakdown of U.S. parents' sales by industry of sales,
only the eight largest sales categories had to be specified.  If
a given U.S. parent had sales in more than eight industries, the
distribution of its sales in the specified industries would have
covered less than 100 percent of its total sales.  Sales in all
unspecified industries combined are shown in this column.

Table II.R1:

1. Profit-type return measures profits from current production.
Unlike net income, it is before income taxes, and it excludes
nonoperating items (such as special charges and capital gains and
losses) and income from equity investments.

2. Equals monetary interest payments plus imputed interest paid
minus monetary interest receipts minus imputed interest received.
Imputed interest paid and received, which are measures of the
value of services provided by life insurance carriers and
financial intermediaries without explicit payment, are estimated
by BEA.

3. Equals taxes other than income and payroll taxes plus
production royalty payments to governments.

Tables II.T1 and II.T4:

1. Applies only to U.S. parent companies that are themselves U.S.
affiliates of foreign companies.  The foreign parent group
consists of (1) the foreign parent of a U.S. parent, (2) any
foreign person, proceeding up the foreign parent's ownership
chain, that owns more than 50 percent of the person below it, and
(3) any foreign person, proceeding down the ownership chain(s) of
each of these members, that is owned more than 50 percent by the
person above it.

2. Does not equal the total in column 4, primarily because column
10 includes trade between U.S. parents and all affiliates, not
just with affiliates that are majority-owned.  In addition, trade
between parents and majority-owned affiliates as reported on
parents' forms (part of column 10) and affiliates' forms (column
4) may differ due to differences in timing and valuation.
Finally, trade between parents and their majority-owned
affiliates that were exempt from being reported on affiliates'
forms is included, in the aggregate, in column 10, but may differ
from BEA estimates of trade with these affiliates included in
column 4.

Tables III.B1-2, III.B3-4, and III.B11-12:

1. Comparable to the sum of columns 3, 4, and 8 of table III.B1
in the 1994 benchmark survey publication.

2. Comparable to column 16 of table III.B1 in the 1994 benchmark
survey publication.

Table III.C1:

1. This item includes total owners' equity of those
unincorporated affiliates for which detail on equity by type
could not be provided.  For these affiliates, cumulative retained
earnings--which are an internal, not an external, source of
funds--and translation adjustments were not reported separately
and could not be excluded.

2. For all industries combined and for each of the selected
industries shown, data in column 2 of this line equals column 12
of table III.B3-4.

Tables III.D6, III.D7, and III.D8:

1. Includes the net book value of "transfers in" of property,
plant, and equipment.  For a given affiliate, "transfers in" are
from its U.S. parent or from other foreign affiliates of its U.S.
parent.

Tables III.E1, III.E2, and III.E8:

1. Consists of gains (losses), net of income tax effects,
resulting from (1) the sale, disposition, or revaluation of
assets; (2) the remeasurement of the foreign affiliates' assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the
affiliate's functional currency, to reflect changes in exchange
rates during the period; (3) transaction gains (losses) taken to
income in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 52; and (4) all other realized and
unrealized gains (losses), that under GAAP are to be included in
income.

2. Consists of unrealized gains (losses), net of income tax
effects, that under GAAP are not included in the determination of
net income.

Table III.F1:

1. Includes sales to the U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates;
equals the sum of columns 5 and 8.

2. Sales charged by an affiliate to persons in the country where
the affiliate is located.

3. "Other" foreign countries are foreign countries other than the
country where the affiliate is located.

Table III.F24:

1. For industry classification, each foreign affiliate was
required to disaggregate its sales by three-digit International
Surveys Industry code; the affiliate was then classified in the
industry in which its sales were largest.  When sales are
disaggregated by industry of affiliate, total sales of a given
affiliate are shown in the single industry in which the
affiliate was classified; when disaggregated by industry of
sales, they are distributed among all the industries in
which the affiliate reported sales--i.e., sales associated with
each industry of sales are shown in that industry regardless of
the affiliate's industry of classification.

2. In the breakdown of foreign affiliates' sales by industry of
sales, only the five largest sales categories had to be
specified.  If an affiliate had sales in more than five
industries, the distribution of its sales in the specified
industries would have covered less than 100 percent of its total
sales.  Sales in all unspecified industries combined are shown in
this column.
