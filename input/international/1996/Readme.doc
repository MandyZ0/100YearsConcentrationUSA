     4. Diskette Information:

        a) This diskette contains two files: this README.DOC file and
           the DIA_FO96.EXE file.  The DOS read-only attribute has been
           set to "on" for both files, and you should make a back-up
           copy of the diskette to insure against accidental loss of
           the original data.

        b) The DIA_FO96.EXE file is a WINZIP-compressed archive of the
           text and tables from the printed publication with the same
           name, with a built-in self extracting utility.

           1) The text is contained in the archived ASCII file called
              TEXT.DOC.  Here you will find the Introductory Notes
              regarding data coverage and methodology, the List of
              Tables, General Notes to Tables, Footnotes, and
              information on ordering other related publications and
              diskettes on U.S. direct investment abroad.  There are
              16 pages of text.

           2) The table files, named TABxxx.TXT (where xxx = table number),
              are in fixed format ASCII.  If you intend to use these tables with a
              spreadsheet program, please refer to your spreadsheet
              manual regarding the methods required to import and
              manipulate ASCII files.

        c) File Extraction Routines: All of the tables and text documentation
           in the archive require about 1,470K bytes of disk storage space in 
           their uncompressed form.  In their compressed form, they occupy about 
           390K bytes on this diskette.  The commands required to extract table 
           or text files are listed below.  

           In Windows, double-click on the icon for  dia_fo96.exe  in the diskette drive.
           In DOS, get into the diskette drive, type  dia_fo96  and press Enter.
           In either case, a window will appear, prompting you to choose a folder in which
           to unzip (decompress) the files.  When you have done this, click the  Unzip
           button to start decompression.
