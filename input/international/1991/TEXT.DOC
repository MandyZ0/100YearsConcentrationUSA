                    U.S. Direct Investment Abroad:
    Operations of U.S. Parent Companies and Their Foreign Affiliates

                      Revised 1991 Estimates

      This publication presents preliminary estimates covering the financial
structure and operations of nonbank U.S. multinational companies (MNC's) and
their nonbank foreign affiliates for fiscal year 1991.  These estimates
supplement those in "U.S. Multinational Companies:  Operations in 1992" in the
June 1994 Survey of Current Business.  That article presents estimates of
key items for 1991 and 1992 and highlights major developments in 1992.
    The estimates in this publication cover the universe of nonbank U.S.
parent companies and their nonbank foreign affiliates.  They were derived by
combining sample data reported in the Annual Survey of U.S. Direct Investment
Abroad, 1992, conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), with BEA
estimates of data for parents and affiliates not in the sample.  Estimates for
nonsample parents and affiliates that existed in prior years were derived by
extrapolating forward the data reported for them in BEA's 1989 benchmark
survey of U.S. direct investment abroad.
      The concepts and definitions underlying the estimates in this
publication are the same as those used for BEA's 1989 benchmark survey.  These
concepts and definitions are described in the benchmark survey publication,
U.S. Direct Investment Abroad:  1989 Benchmark Survey, Final Results, which
was published in October 1992.
      Publications presenting estimates comparable to the 1991 estimates in
this publication are available for 1977, for 1982-90 and for 1992.  The
estimates for 1982-92 are also available in computer-readable formats (tape or
diskette).  Ordering information for publications and computer media is given
at the back of this volume.
      Because the estimates for 1977, 1982, and 1989 are based on benchmark
surveys--which are more comprehensive in scope than annual
surveys--publications for those years contain measures of MNC operations that
are not available for other years.  Types of data that are collected only in
benchmark surveys include hourly compensation of production workers of foreign
affiliates in manufacturing, U.S. merchandise trade of MNC's by product, and
the number of U.S. citizens employed by foreign affiliates.
      Table 1 lists the tables in this publication and gives the numbers of
comparable tables in the annual survey publications for 1983-88 and in the 
1989 benchmark survey publication.  To aid comparison between the 1989
benchmark survey data and the annual survey estimates for subsequent years,
the table numbers in the annual survey publications for 1990 forward,
including those in this publication, are identical to the ones used for the
comparable table in the final 1989 benchmark survey publication.  Thus, tables
prefixed with Roman numeral II present estimates for nonbank foreign
affiliates and their nonbank U.S. parents, and tables prefixed with Roman
numeral III present estimates for majority-owned nonbank foreign affiliates of
nonbank U.S. parents.  (Unlike the 1989 benchmark survey publication, Roman
numeral I is not used to number tables in this publication because it
designates tables covering all foreign affiliates and their U.S. parents,
including bank parents and affiliates, which are not covered by this
publication.)

      In some cases, BEA may make special tabulations or perform regressions
or other statistical analyses of annual servey data at cost, within limits of
available resources and subject to the legal requirements to avoid disclosure
of data of individual companies.  However, because of the high degree of
detail in which BEA's data are regularly produced and because of concerns
about confidentiality, data quality, and consistency of presentation, the
Bureau has adopted a policy of generally limiting tabulations to those
regularly produced. Data users requiring special tabulations should submit
their requests, including a justification of need, in writing, and BEA will
consider each request on a case-by-case basis.  Requests should be directed
to:  International Investment Division (BE-50), Data Retrieval and Analysis
Branch, Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington,
DC 20230.

                            General Notes to Tables

-  The estimates are on a fiscal year (FY) basis; an affiliate's or parent's
   fiscal year is defined as the financial reporting year that ended in that
   calendar year.  Unless otherwise specified, all balances are as of the
   close of FY 1990.
-  Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
-  An asterisk "(*)" indicates a value between -$500,000 and +$500,000, or
   fewer than 50 employees, as appropriate. 
-  A "(D)" indicates that the data in the cell have been suppressed to avoid
   disclosure of data of individual companies.
-  A "U.S. parent company" is the person, resident in the United States, that
   owns or controls 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an
   incorporated foreign business enterprise or an equivalent interest in an
   unincorporated foreign business enterprise.  "Person" is broadly defined to
   include any individual, branch, partnership, associated group, association,
   estate, trust, corporation or other organization (whether or not organized
   under the laws of any State), or any government entity.  If incorporated,
   the U.S. parent is the fully consolidated U.S. enterprise consisting of (1)
   the U.S. corporation whose voting securities are not owned more than 50
   percent by another U.S. corporation, and (2) proceeding down each ownership
   chain from that U.S. corporation, any U.S. corporation (including Foreign
   Sales Corporations located within the United States) whose voting
   securities are more than 50 percent owned by the U.S. corporation above it.

    A U.S. parent comprises the domestic (U.S.) operations of a U.S.
   multinational company.
-  A "foreign affiliate" is a foreign business enterprise in which there is
   U.S. direct investment, that is, in which a U.S. person owns or controls 10
   percent of the voting securities or the equivalent. 
-  A "majority-owned foreign affiliate" is a foreign affiliate in which the
   combined direct and indirect ownership interest of all U.S. parents exceeds
   50 percent. 
-  A "U.S. multinational company" (MNC) comprises the U.S. parent and all of
   its foreign affiliates.
-  A "nonbank" entity (MNC, parent, or affiliate) is one whose primary
   activity is not banking.  Only nonbank entities are covered by this
   publication.
-  The designation "by country" in a table title indicates that data are
   disaggregated by country of foreign affiliate. 
-  Unless otherwise specified, the designation "by industry" in a table title 

   indicates that the data are disaggregated by industry of foreign affiliate.
-  For tables that do not show every individual country or industry, the 
   individual countries or industries included in a country or industry group
   shown in the heading or stub may be ascertained by referring to table II.A1
   or III.A1 (for countries) or table II.A2 or III.A2 (for industries).  The
   industries listed in tables II.A2 and III.A2 are described in BEA's Guide
   to Industry and Foreign Trade Classifications for International Surveys. 
-  The country category "international" consists of affiliates that have
   operations spanning more than one country and that are engaged in petroleum
   shipping, other water transportation, or oil and gas drilling.
-  "Eastern Europe" comprises Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, 
   Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and the Union of Soviet 
   Socialist Republics. 
-  The European Communities (12) comprises Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France,
   Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the
   United Kingdom.

-  OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Through yearend
   1992, its members were Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
   Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
   and Venezuela.
-  The major industry classification "petroleum" includes all of the various
   three-digit BEA petroleum subindustries.  All other major industries
   exclude these petroleum subindustries.  For example, mining excludes crude
   petroleum (no refining) and gas; manufacturing excludes petroleum refining
   and coal products; retail trade excludes gasoline service stations; and
   wholesale trade excludes petroleum wholesale trade. 
-  All footnotes follow the last table.

                       Footnotes to Tables

Table II.K1:

      1. Includes capitalized expenditures for land, timber, mineral and like
         rights owned, structures, machinery, equipment, special tools, and
         other depreciable property; construction in progress; and capitalized
         and expensed tangible and intangible exploration and development
         costs (but not the costs of other types of intangible assets) and
         land held for resale.
      2. Measures expenditures for research and development performed for the
         parents' benefit either by the parents themselves or by others under
         contract.  Excludes expenditures for research and development
         conducted by parents for others under contract.

Table II.O1:

      1. Sales of goods are defined as sales generated by activities
         characteristic of the following group of industries:  Agriculture,
         except agricultural services; mining, except mining services;
         petroleum, except petroleum services; construction; manufacturing;
         and wholesale and retail trade.
      2. Sales of services are defined as sales generated by activities
         characteristic of the following group of industries:  The "services"
         division of the Standard Industrial Classification (and the
         International Surveys Industry Classification) system; petroleum
         services; finance, insurance, and real estate; agricultural services;
         mining services; transportation; communications; and public
         utilities. 
      3. Consists of investment income that is included in sales (or gross
         operating revenues) in the income statement.  In finance and
         insurance, parents generally include investment income in sales
         because it is generated by a primary activity of the company.  In
         most other industries, parents generally consider investment income
         an incidental revenue source and include it in the income statement
         in a separate "other income" category; in such cases, investment
         income is not included in parents' sales or in this column.

Table II.O2:

      1. For industry classification, each U.S. parent was required to
         disaggregate its sales by three-digit International Surveys Industry
         code; the U.S. parent was then classified in the industry in which
         its sales were largest.  When sales are disaggregated by industry of
         U.S. parent, total sales of a given U.S. parent are shown in the
         single industry in which the parent was classified; when
         disaggregated by industry of sales, they are distributed among all
         the industries in which the U.S. parent reported sales--i.e., sales
         associated with each industry of sales are shown in that industry
         regardless of the U.S. parent's industry of classification.
      2. In the breakdown of U.S. parents' sales by industry of sales, only
         the eight largest sales categories had to be specified.  If a given
         U.S. parent had sales in more than eight industries, the distribution
         of its sales in the specified industries would have covered less than
         100 percent of its total sales.  Sales in all unspecified industries
         combined are shown in this column.

Tables II.Q1 and II.Q4:

      1. Applies only to U.S. parent companies that are themselves U.S. 
         affiliates of foreign companies.  The foreign parent group consists
         of (1) the foreign parent of a U.S. parent, (2) any foreign person,
         proceeding up the foreign parent's ownership chain, that owns more
         than 50 percent of the person below it, and (3) any foreign person,
         proceeding down the ownership chain(s) of each of these members, that
         is owned more than 50 percent by the person above it. 
      2. Does not equal column 2, which is derived from data reported on
         affiliates' forms, because of differences in timing and valuation and
         the inclusion of data for affiliates covered on U.S. parents' forms
         but exempt from being reported on affiliates' forms.

Tables III.B1-2, III.B3-4, and III.B13-14:

      1. Comparable to the sum of columns 3, 4, and 8 of table III.B1 in the
         1989 benchmark survey publication.
      2. Comparable to the sum of columns 13 and 14 of table III.B1 in the
         1989 benchmark survey publication.

Table III.C1:

      1. This item includes total owners' equity of those unincorporated
         affiliates for which detail on equity by type could not be provided. 
         For these affiliates, cumulative retained earnings--which are an
         internal, not an external, source of funds--and translation
         adjustmenst were not reported separately and could not be excluded.
      2. For all industries combined and for each of the selected industries
         shown, data in column 2 of this line--position with all transactors
         combined--equals column 11 of table III.B3-4.

Tables III.E1, III.E2, and III.E8:

      1. Consists of gains (losses), net of income tax effects, resulting from
         (1) the sale, disposition, or revaluation of assets; (2) the
         remeasurement of the foreign affiliates' assets and liabilities
         denominated in foreign currencies other than the affiliate's
         functional currency, to reflect changes in exchange rates during the
         period; (3) transaction gains (losses) taken to income in accordance
         with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52 (FASB 52);
         and (4) all other realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of
         income tax effects, that under U.S. generally accepted accounting
         principles (GAAP) are to be included in income.  
      2. Consists of unrealized gains (losses), net of income tax effects,
         that under GAAP are not included in the determination of net income.

Table III.F1: 

      1. Includes sales to the U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates; equals
         the sum of columns 5 and 8.  
      2. Sales charged by an affiliate to persons in the country where the
         affiliate is located.
      3. "Other" foreign countries are foreign countries other than the
         country where the affiliate is located.
      4. See footnote 1 to table II.O1.

      5. See footnote 2 to table II.O1.
      6. Consists of investment income that is included in sales (or gross
         operating revenues) in the income statement.  In finance and
         insurance, affiliates generally include investment income in sales
         because it is generated by a primary activity of the company.  In
         most other industries, affiliates generally consider investment
         income an incidental revenue source and include it in the income
         statement in a separate "other income" category; in such cases,
         investment income is not included in affiliates' sales or in this
         line.

Table III.F24:
      1. For industry classification, each foreign affiliate was required to
         disaggregate its sales by three-digit International Surveys Industry
         code; the affiliate was then classified in the industry in which its
         sales were largest.  When sales are disaggregated by industry of
         affiliate, total sales of a given affiliate are shown in the single
         industry in which the affiliate was classified; when disaggregated by
         industry of sales, they are distributed among all the industries in
         which the affiliate reported sales--i.e., sales associated with each
         industry of sales are shown in that industry regardless of the
         affiliate's industry of classification.
      2. In the breakdown of foreign affiliates' sales by industry of sales,
         only the five largest sales categories had to be specified.  If an
         affiliate had sales in more than five industries, the distribution of
         its sales in the specified industries would have covered less than
         100 percent of its total sales.  Sales in all unspecified industries
         combined are shown in this column.

   Ordering Publications and Diskettes on U.S. Direct Investment Abroad

       Information on how to order additional BEA data on the operations of
U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates is given below.

      Estimates that are comparable with those presented in this publication
are available for 1977 and for 1982-90, but the level of detail
    in which the estimates are presented, and the number of data items
covered, differ:  The publications for 1977, 1982,  and 1989
    (benchmark years) present the estimates in greater detail and cover many
more data items than those in publications for non-benchmark years.

      The estimates are available in publications and--for some years--on
computer tape or diskette.  The publications for 1977 and 1982 are
    available from the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical
Information Service (NTIS).  The publications for 1983-85 are available
    from BEA, the publications for 1986-88 are available form NTIS, and the
publications for 1989-91 are available from the Superintendent of
    Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO). A computer tape of the
1982 data, and computer diskettes of the 1983-91 data, are available
    from BEA.

      To place an order, use the BEA, GPO, and NTIS order forms provided on
the following pages.  Orders should specify the accession or stock
    number, the title of the publication or the year of the estimates (for
computer tapes or diskettes), and the price of the item(s) being ordered. 
Files
    on diskettes are copied, using DOS, onto 3 1/2-inch diameter high density
diskettes.  Documentation is included.

      Payment must accompany all orders.
