                       Revised 1986 Estimates


     This publication presents revised estimates covering the
financial structure and operations of nonbank U.S. companies and
their nonbank foreign affiliates for fiscal year 1986. These
estimates supplement those in "U.S. Multinational Companies:
Operations in 1987," in the June 1989 SURVEY OF CURRENT BUSINESS.
That article presented estimates of key items for 1986 and 1987,
provided highlights of the operations of U.S. multinational
companies (MNC's) in 1987 based on changes in assets, sales,
employment, and U.S. merchandise trade, and discussed, in more
detail, sales of services by U.S. MNC's in 1987.
     The 1986 estimates were obtained by expanding to universe
totals sample data collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in
the Annual Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, 1986. The
estimating procedure used is parallel to that for the Annual Survey
of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States discussed in
"U.S. Affiliates of Foreign Companies: Operations in 1982," in the
December 1984 SURVEY.
     Publications presenting estimates comparable to the 1986
estimates in this publication are available for 1982-85 and 1987.
The estimates for 1983-85 and 1987 are contained in separate
publications for each year.  Estimates for 1982, which are from
BEA's most recent benchmark survey, are published in U.S. Direct
Investment Abroad: 1982 Benchmark Survey Data.  The estimates for
1983-87 are also available on computer diskette.  Ordering
information for the publications and diskettes is at the back of
this publication.
     The concepts and definitions underlying the 1986 estimates are
the same as those used for BEA's 1982 benchmark survey. To aid
comparison of the 1986 annual survey estimates and the 1982 bench-
mark survey data, a list of tables that provides cross-references
to the tables in the benchmark survey publication is presented.
     Some of the tables in the benchmark survey publication do not
have a counterpart in this publication, primarily because the
annual survey excludes many items that were included in the bench-
mark survey.
     In a few instances, data items collected separately in the
benchmark survey were combined with other items in the annual
survey. Thus, two or more items that appeared separately in a table
in the benchmark survey publication may be shown as a single item
in the corresponding table in this publication. Such instances are
noted in the footnotes to the tables.
     Tables 1 through 19 present estimates for all nonbank foreign
affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents, tables 20 through 53 present                                                  Page 2 of 16

estimates for majority-owned nonbank foreign affiliates of nonbank
U.S. parents, and tables 54 through 58 present estimates for
nonbank U.S. parents.
     Beginning with 1985, three columns (columns 13, 14, and 15)
have been added to tables 34, 35, and 39-42 in order to show total
sales by affiliates to foreign countries, and the portion of the
total that is to other foreign affiliates and the portion that is
to unaffiliated foreigners. Comparable data for 1983 and 1984 can
be calculated as the sum of columns 4 and 10 (equals column 13),
columns 5 and 11 (equals column 14), and columns 6 and 12 (equals 
column 15) of the corresponding tables in the publications for
those years.
     The annual survey data are stored on magnetic tape. BEA can
make special tabulations or perform regressions or other
statistical analyses of the data at cost, within the limits of
available resources and subject to the legal requirement to avoid
disclosure of data of individual companies. Requests should be

  major industries exclude these petroleum subindustries. For
  example, mining excludes crude petroleum (no refining) and gas;
  manufacturing excludes petroleum refining and coal products;
  retail trade excludes gasoline service stations; and wholesale 
  trade excludes petroleum wholesale trade.
- OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The
  members of OPEC are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
  Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United
  Arab Emirates, and Venezuela.
- The country category "International" consists of affiliates that
  have operations spanning more than one country and that are
  engaged in petroleum shipping, other water transportation, or oil
  and gas drilling.
- Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
- For items shown in millions of dollars, an asterisk (*) indicates
  an amount between -$500,000 and +$500,000; for items shown in
  thousands of employees, it indicates a number between 0 and 50.
- A "(D)" indicates that the data in the cell have been suppressed
  to avoid disclosure of data of individual companies.
- The individual countries or industries included in a country or
  industry group shown in the heading or stub of a table may be 
  ascertained by referring to table 1 (for countries) or table 2 
  (for industries).
- All footnotes follow the last table.                                                    Page 8 of 16

Table 45:
        1. For industry classification, each foreign affiliate was
           required to disaggregate its sales by three-digit
           industry; the affiliate was first classified in a major
           industry group (e.g., mining, petroleum, or manufac-
           turing), and then was classified in the industry in this
           group in which its sales were largest.  When sales are
           disaggregated by industry of affiliate, total sales of
           a given affiliate are shown in the single industry in
           which the affiliate was classified; when disaggregated
           by industry of sales, they are distributed among all the
           industries in which the affiliate reported sales---i.e.,
           sales associated with each industry of sales are shown
           in that industry regardless of the affiliate's industry
           of classification.
        2. In the breakdown of foreign affiliates' sales by
           industry of sales, only the five largest categories had
           to be specified.  If a given affiliate had sales in more
           than five industries, the distribution of its sales in
           the specified industries would have covered less than
           100 percent of its total sales.  Sales in all unspeci-
           fied industries combined are shown in this column.

           major industry group (e.g., mining, petroleum, or
           manufacturing), and then was classified in the industry
           in this group in which its sales were largest.  When
           sales are disaggregated by industry of U.S. parent, 
           total sales of a given U.S. parent are shown in the
           single industry in which the U.S. parent was classified;
           when disaggregated by industry of sales, they are
           distributed among all the industries in which the U.S.
           parent reported sales---i.e., sales associated with each
           industry of sales are shown in that industry regardless
           of the U.S. parent's industry of classification.                                                    Page 14 of 16

           Includes data for nonbank U.S. parents of nonbank
           affiliates.  The comparable table III.N2 in the 1982
           benchmark survey publication includes data only for 
           nonbank U.S. parents of majority-owned nonbank affil-
           iates.  Thus, this table includes, but table III.N2 in
           the 1982 benchmark survey publication excludes, data for
           U.S. parents that have only minority-owned affiliates. 
           Data for these parents are probably small.
        2. In the breakdown of U.S. parents' sales by industry of
           sales, only the eight largest categories had to be
           specified.  If a given U.S. parent had sales in more
           than eight industries, the distribution of its sales in
           the specified industries would have covered less than
           100 percent of its total sales.  Sales in all unspeci-
           fied industries combined are shown in this column.
