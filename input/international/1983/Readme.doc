     4. Diskette Information:

        a) This diskette contains two files: this README.DOC file and
           the EXTRACT.EXE file.  The DOS read-only attribute has been
           set to "on" for both files, and you should make a back-up
           copy of the diskette to insure against accidental loss of
           the original data.

        b) The EXTRACT.EXE file is a PKZIP-compressed archive of the
           text and of Tables 1A through 58 from the printed
           publication with the same name, with a built-in self
           extracting utility.

           1) The text is contained in the archived ASCII file called
              TEXT.DOC.  Here you will find the Introductory Notes
              regarding data coverage and methodology, the List of
              Tables, General Notes to Tables, Footnotes, and
              information on ordering other related publications and
              diskettes on United States direct investment abroad.
              There are 16 pages of text.

           2) The table files, named TABLEx.PRN (where x = table number),
              are in fixed format ASCII; the line width is 160
              characters.  If you intend to use these tables with a
              spreadsheet program, please refer to your spreadsheet
              manual regarding the methods required to import and
              manipulate ASCII files.                                            Page 2 of 2

        c) File Extraction Routines: All of the tables and text
           documentation in the archive require about 1,114K bytes of 
           disk storage space in their uncompressed form.  In their
           compressed form, they occupy about 277K bytes on this      
           diskette.  The commands required to extract table or text
           files are listed below.  To execute these commands, the
           floppy drive that contains this diskette must be the
           current drive.

           1) To view a listing of all the file names in the archive
              on your screen, the command is:
                         EXTRACT -T|MORE

           2) To send a listing of all the file names in the archive
              to your printer, the command is:                   
                         EXTRACT -T>PRN

           3) To extract the uncompressed version of ONE particular   
              file, for example the TEXT.DOC file, to the same drive  
              you are currently on, the command is:                   
                         EXTRACT TEXT.DOC

           4) To extract the uncompressed version of ONE particular
              file, for example the TEXT.DOC file, to a different     
              drive, the command is:
                         EXTRACT TEXT.DOC d:{\directory}
                         (where d = desired drive and
                          {directory is optional})

           5) To extract the uncompressed version of ALL files to a
              different drive, the command is:
                         EXTRACT *.* d:{\directory}
                         (where d = desired drive and
                          {directory is optional})
              (This is the most efficient routine for users with hard
              disks.)
